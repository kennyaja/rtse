# [r]un [t]his [s]omewhere [e]lse

**rtse** is a command line tool for running and displaying output of commands in another shell instance (e.g. inside another pane of a terminal multiplexer). It could be useful in some workflows. I don't really know about any other uses.

As of right now, it only runs on Linux and other Unix-based systems (untested) due to its reliance on [Unix domain sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket).
